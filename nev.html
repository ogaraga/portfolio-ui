        <P><b style="color: brown;">PREAMBLE:</b>
            
            In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. He created all kinds of living creatures and inanimate things. All these creations were made just for one person—man. God did not stop there; he gave man the ascendancy and supremacy over all these creations, to rule and to dominate ad infinitum. 
            In the same vein, this idea-unleashing and inspiration-giving book is actually put together for a particular set of people to attain to their ultimate goal fast and be consistent in pursuance of their very goals in order to dominate and rule in their sphere of contacts. Are you are among this set of people? These set of people are people who are ready to accept to face storm and finally overcome them. They are highly ambitious and very preoccupied with strategical methodology to have their set targets and desires accomplished within the clear, written and specified time frame: if they (goals, desire, etc) don’t materialized within the set time, these people who know how to play different set of rules, don’t quit and grow cold. 
            Don’t dare into opening this book if you are not a positivity thinker, if you are not a darer, if you are not ready to appreciably welcome storms when they come, if you are not a seeker of the topmost rung of the ladder of greatness and if you believe you can’t survive in any venture: this is because this book is loaded with laden daggers that seldom penetrate the minds of the weaklings and pessimists. For the possibility thinkers and darers of all dimensions, and those who are not but desire to be in the latter category of people, the insights and words embedded in this book are their strength and propeller. 
              Still in line, for whatever reason you—weakling and pessimists—hunger after this book, make up your mind right now to drop your negative attitude and spirit of pessimism to be able to enjoy with great relish what this book has offered you. You surely will be changed as you follow the ideas and success key spelt out therein. 
            This book will give you an insight of what it takes to be great and become rich just with simple application of the facts that vehicled the great men of our time up the ladder of legendary. My background and the backgrounds of some great possibility thinkers in this book will spur you to actions.   
            Even though it’s a fact that education can aid in moving faster in our world today, but this book tells you that education is most likely immaterial as a factor that determines whether you can succeed or not with the life testimony of Brian Tracy who rose from a dishwasher to a multimillionaire with employees under his command. 
            This world is stuffed with ripped possibilities and it is only those who are willing to pay the prize would receive their unanticipated calls. Paying the prize is being ready to face the raging storm of life that will come in between your sleeping time and adventures. You must be ready to admit responsibilities and focus your entire energy towards fighting back the storm before you can most likely overcome their intense darts. Possibility-thinkers, goal-oriented and wealth- surfers in the midst of choking fire are sure ready to fight back. If you are not among such darers then decide to be one today and watch your life grow tremendously amidst all variegation of breath-taking turbulent provisos.
            According to Brian Tracy, “a goal, however, is something distinctly different from a wish. It is clear, written, and specific. It can be quickly and easily described to another person. You can measure it, and you know when you have achieved it or not”. This is diametrically a key to success—abundance of success! The day I set my eyes on those clauses above by Mr. Brian, my life tilted optimally towards achieving more in the world full of uncountable resources. Following the same permutation, if you must grasp the secrets and keys of success divulged in this book, you really have to put pen by your side. The ideas and secrets herein are already waiting for the lucky person they can impinge themselves on and penetrate. To be able to catch them, then you must voraciously scan this book with a writing material besides you as well as a writing material in the innermost. This will help you develop focus on what you really wanted in life. I actually knew what I wanted to be in life: a cross-continental motivational speaker of this generation, a lifter of dying souls with ideas and creativity. Until I heard Brian Tracy spoke to me via his book “goals” I could not have written it down as clearly as specific as quickly as easily as it can be described to anyone( you) that wants to know. Today, I am already toeing in that direction. You too can! Don’t read this book casually or the way you read for exams. Put something down and get ready now to trigger into action.
            Life is war. Why is life war? What makes life a war zone? This book will help teach why it is so and what you need to do not to be a victim of war. You have to read with maximum concentration to be able to see these points where they are spelt out. War is an upshot of conflictual elemental forces such as aggression, injustice, jeopardy, frustrations, denials, poverty and total subjugation of humanity by either their environments or fellow human beings. The converse of war is peace and if you are a strong seeker of peace, then open the leaflets of this book painstakingly and browse the website of peace detailed herein.
            This book is modeled after the work of Andres Lara. This mean you can read and carefully scan through this book from any reference point as there is not order you have to follow before you can grab all that this book has to offer. Every chapter is insightful and motivating; just be ready to receive beyond expectation as you deliberately surf through the net of this book. The net as used is the ideas and key secrets that are revealed and dropped for you to pick up. Pick them and document them and rule your world therewith. 
            Something is certainly happening to you right now for having got to this paragraph. I welcome you therefore into the world of possibilities where your inputs cannot go uncelebrated as you get ready to venture into this book <em style="color: yellow;">[The end of preamble!]</em>. Thank you!
