        <summary>THE BOOK</summary>
        <P class="surv-odd"><span id="surving">NAJI AND SNOW</span>:
            Uzoma was born to the family of okorie Igwe a decade prior to the war that tore apart Snownaji and its natural endowments resulting to the decrepitude of her polity and natural resources. Okorie Igwe was a notable chieftaincy titled village head whose lifestyle had earned him respect and honour from all and sundry in kabia community. 
            He was married to Alice Igwe nee Alice Okoro in 1955. Their major problem had been the issue of child bearing and for this reason they succeeded in having Uzoma as their only child. Igwe’s benevolence and humanitarian proclivity earned him much fame across the entire community. He indeed was a man of great gravitas and there was none in the land that didn’t benefit from his clemency. 
            Notwithstanding Igwe’s godly disposition to fellow humanity, he in fact was living in abject poverty in all ramifications. He was given the chieftaincy title because of his integrity and empathy to fellow community man. A man who could give the last he had in a bid to put a grin on the face of the worried without considering his subsistent living: Such a man should be appreciated with a chieftaincy title tribute.
            Igwe’s lifestyle and his predisposition to attending to villager’s predicaments made some village chiefs envy him with evil intentions. They (some village chiefs, led by Ekwe) slyly met to deliberate on how Igwe would be assassinated. This they concluded waiting the day the assassins were instructed to waylay Igwe. 
            Inadvertently, there was war outbreak between the Snow and the Naji over evil perpetrations involving pogrom of the people of Snow by the Naji people. Following the ungodly and unhumanistic waste of lives of the people of Snow, urgent symposium was convened outside the boundary of Snownaji for a solution to end the killings of the Snowans. 
            The wind of the war raged the more and eventually broke out after the referendum could not yield any meaningful upshot. Now, the war had begun and men were being conscripted into the army with little or no drilling. The Snow’s soldiers were parading across every city and state to force matured men into the army. It was on this that those evil chiefs bribed one of their wives, Elemma, to inform the solders in their community the whereabouts of chief Igwe as he went into hiding. As a result, Igwe was captured and conscripted into the army.
            Six months after the intense war, it was reported that Igwe was shot dead, though not by his opponents but by one of the chiefs, Nwoke, who was unlucky to escape the call of war. He shot him while they were both firing at their enemies and he reported that it was the enemies’ bullets. He forgot that a notable village hunter, Mazi Apolo, saw him. The irony of it all was that the killer chief was captured alive by the Naji’s Solders and was hanged to death thereafter. 
            Igwe’s untimely departure became an acid on the body of Alice Igwe, his spouse, and she could not survive this. Her quietus came a month after Igwe’s demise. Igwe and wife’s early transition to great beyond left a terrible shock on Uzoma and made him an orphan too early. This was the alpha of his uneven and pathetic suffering—his baptism of fire. The war continued until the Snowans retreated and surrendered to the Najis. 
             Shortly after the war ended, Uzoma at his 8 suffered to the point that he was withdrawn from school due to his inability to pay school fees. He had to move to stay with his father’s younger brother, Ekwe, who gave Uzoma the greatest shock of his life; Uzoma could not believe it. Ekwe, who was eating from the covers of late Igwe’s little earnings, asked Uzoma’s principal, Mr. Ozo, to withdraw him from school as he claimed he could not afford his fees. A month later, Ekwe stopped fending for Uzoma for no reason. 
            Life was bitter and chaos for Uzoma. Uzoma became grievously sick due to malnutrition and unpalatable treatments from his uncle. It was at the point where Uzoma’s health had gotten to its nadir level that a good village Samaritan from a neigbouring village named Kwa was moved with compassion to hospitalize him, through her Kabia friend, Mmirioma, who reported it to her. Uloma admitted Uzoma and gave him some natural medications; placing him on balanced diet until he recovered from the ailment of kwashiorkor and other associated diseases[<span style="color: red;">end</span>].
